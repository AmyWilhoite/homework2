        <p>I'm a business professional who has over 20 years of experience in the private sector. I have business experience in many things but primarily business operations. I've worked with teams of developers on many different technology projects from a "client side" including CRMS, apps and websites. I hope to learn more about technology specifically development so that I can better serve businesses from an operational capacity. </p>
